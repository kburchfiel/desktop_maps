# Public-Domain Desktop Maps (Work in progress)

This project will contain code for creating several maps that can serve as desktop backgrounds. (All of these maps can be downloaded from the [maps](https://github.com/kburchfiel/desktop_maps/tree/main/maps) folder.) These maps are meant to be aesthetically pleasing (to me, at least!) rather than informative. If you'd like to learn how to generate more 'useful' maps, visit the [Mapping](https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn/tree/main/Mapping) section of my Python for Nonprofits guide.

One notable feature of these maps is that they use *only* public-domain source data. The shapefiles (e.g. boundaries of various regions) on which the maps are based come from the US Census, so there isn't any copyright associated with them. (The maps also don't use any tile services, so there aren't any copyright restrictions there either.) I have decided to release these maps into the public domain also. The code that builds the maps is released under the MIT license, so you can use it without cost for a wide range of purposes (commercial or otherwise).
