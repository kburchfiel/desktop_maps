# Desktop Maps (Work in progress)

This project will contain code for creating several maps that can serve as desktop backgrounds. These maps are meant to be aesthetically pleasing rather than informative. If you'd like to learn how to generate more 'useful' maps, visit the [Mapping](https://github.com/kburchfiel/pfn/tree/main/Mapping) section of my Python for Nonprofits guide.
